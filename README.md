# Project Profile:
"My Driving Force" is a minimal application used to fuel my motivation. The purpose is to consolidate all my action into a holistic, full-integrated, and focused effort.

This app will display My Ultimate Vision, My Ultimate Purpose, and subsequently all actions that follow such as Categories of Constant Improvement, Key Results, Projects, and more specific results related to my Ultimate Vision.

All information will be structured, formatted, and presented based on Tony Robbins' RPM system, which places Visions in the center, Purposes on the right, and Actions on the left.

The project stack includes Angular.js, HTML5, and CSS3; GitHub; and Firebase. 

The app will serve as a framework and content will be pulled from Trello using the Trello API.
